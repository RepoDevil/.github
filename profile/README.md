I have been an Android developer since Android became a platform. I developed custom ROMs for the G1 and was responsible for many scripts and toolkits that made it possible to port custom ROMs between early Android devices. I provided the camera HAL for the HTC Thunderbolt to the custom ROM community and developed the first custom kernel for the Note 4. I made one of the first custom kernels for the HTC Evo 3D and all of the Nvidia Shield devices. I have built drivers that were carried on all the way into the Note 10.

I spent a decent amount of time as one of the reicast team members, designing both significant portions of the UI and hardware interface code. While most of my work was on the frontend, I provided the native backend to support the Xperia Play.

I have published multiple apps on Google Play, the most recent of which are TagMo and SamSprung, which also happens to be one of the only two cover screen launchers currently available. The Flip series specifically disables cover screen launchers and blocks keyboards. I built both a launcher and keyboard that are able to function normally, bypassing the restrictions that prevent them.

I have two degrees. One is a bachelor's in mobile development. The other is a master's in mobile game development. My thesis projects were a fully-functional 3D mobile virtual assistant, an endless sidescroller that integrated with the user's music library, and an action game that had support for DLC, variable maps, and multiple modes, including driving and flying.
